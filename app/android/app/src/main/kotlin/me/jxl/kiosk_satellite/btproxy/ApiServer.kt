/**
 * The ESPHome native API server the proxy exposes to Home Assistant.
 *
 * Pure JVM on purpose: no Android imports, so the whole session lifecycle
 * runs under plain unit tests with a real aioesphomeapi client on the other
 * end of a socket. The Android layer supplies the BLE scanner through
 * [ScannerBackend] and receives scanner start/stop demands back.
 *
 * Reliability decisions baked in here, each one a documented failure of a
 * prior Android proxy:
 *
 *  - Every session writes through its own bounded queue and writer thread.
 *    A half-open peer (HA restarted, Wi-Fi roamed) stops draining its TCP
 *    buffer; a direct write would block whichever thread flushed next and
 *    silently stall every other client's traffic with it. Here the stuck
 *    session's queue fills, the session is closed, everyone else is
 *    untouched.
 *  - SO_KEEPALIVE plus an application-level ping: the server sends its own
 *    PingRequest over idle links and reaps sessions that stay silent past
 *    the timeout, so a dead HA connection is discovered in seconds, not
 *    never.
 *  - BluetoothScannerSetModeRequest acknowledges without restarting when
 *    the mode already matches. HA sends one immediately after subscribing;
 *    proxies that answered it with a scanner restart looped forever on
 *    HA 2026.6.
 *  - Advertisement forwarding dedups on payload change but still forwards
 *    unchanged payloads at a short interval so RSSI keeps flowing:
 *    room-presence integrations live on RSSI updates, and the 10-second
 *    suppression windows other proxies ship read as a dead scanner.
 *  - Unknown message types are ignored, malformed known ones are logged and
 *    ignored; only transport-level errors end a session. HA grows the
 *    schema every release.
