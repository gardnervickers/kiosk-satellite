/**
 * Streams 16 kHz mono PCM16 microphone audio to Dart over an EventChannel.
 *
 * Implemented natively (AudioRecord) rather than via a pub package because the
 * available streaming-mic packages don't build against AGP 9. onListen starts
 * capture; onCancel (Dart cancelling the subscription) stops it and releases
 * the mic — which is what frees it for the WebView's getUserMedia during STT.
 *
 * Capture DSP: echo cancellation on by default, with optional noise suppression and AGC.
 * We share capture settings across wake word inference, the stop word, STT
 * and RTSP audio:
 *
 *  - Echo cancellation earns its keep because the stop word listens *while*
 *    TTS plays out of this same device. Without it the mic hears our own
 *    speech and scores it.
 *  - Noise suppression and AGC default to off. Users can
 *    adjust both for their microphone. Both change the signal recognition receives.
 *
 * VOICE_COMMUNICATION rather than MIC is deliberate: it is the capture path
 * that carries the playback reference AEC needs. On a MIC session the effect
 * usually attaches and then silently does nothing. The tradeoff is that this
 * source also applies the platform's own NS/AGC by default, which is exactly
 * what [applyDsp] configures from the user's settings.
 * SoundPlayer must also use communication playback and a communication
 * session. Enabling the capture effect alone does not cancel media playback
 * on devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8.
 *
 * Capture tuning is configurable because on custom
 * ROMs they are exactly what goes wrong: VOICE_COMMUNICATION is the phone-call
 * capture path, and a ROM that never had its call audio calibrated can deliver
 * it 20 dB down while a recorder app on plain MIC sounds fine. The defaults are
 * the behaviour described above; the overrides arrive as stream arguments,
 * which is why a change of any of them reopens capture.
 *
 * Channel selection: multichannel USB arrays put differently-processed
 * signals on each channel (the reSpeaker XVF3800 sends its comms output on
 * channel 1 and its raw ASR output on channel 2), and Android's stereo-to-
 * mono contraction averages them, polluting the clean channel with the
 * processed one. A `channel` argument of 1..N opens capture with a channel
 * index mask wide enough to include it and forwards only that channel; 0 (the
 * default) is the platform's mono downmix, the app's historical behavior.
 *
 * Capture format: the engines want 16 kHz mono and that is what capture
 * asks for, leaving the platform to convert from whatever the microphone
 * does. Some sound cards record at 48 kHz stereo and nothing else, and an
 * audio HAL that hands the app's format straight to ALSA then refuses the
 * open, reads nothing but errors or delivers the card's frames misread as
 * 16 kHz mono. Capture therefore walks a ladder of shapes ([captureLadder])
 * and steps down it when an open is refused, when reads return only errors
 * or zeros, when a read blocks for good (the HAL could not read the card, so
 * AudioFlinger has nothing to hand over), or when the delivered frame rate
 * does not match the rate opened (the format under the label is not the one
 * asked for). Silence is weak
 * evidence, so [CaptureWalk] decides how much of it a rung gets, where
 * capture lands when the whole ladder has been tried and when it may walk
 * again. Anything but 16 kHz mono is converted here ([CaptureConvert]). A
 * `format` argument of "hardware" starts the ladder at the card's 48 kHz
 * stereo.
