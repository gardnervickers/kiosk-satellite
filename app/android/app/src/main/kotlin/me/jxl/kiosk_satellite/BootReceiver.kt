/**
 * Launches the kiosk when the device powers on, if the "Start on boot"
 * setting is on. The Flutter engine is not running at boot, so the setting
 * is read straight from the shared_preferences store ("flutter." + the
 * app's "ks." prefix). On Android 10+ a background activity start is only
 * honored because the app holds the draw-over-apps grant — the setting's
 * description sends the user to that permission. The keep-alive service is
 * started first and separately: a boot receiver may always start a
 * foreground service, so the kiosk's connections come up even on a device
 * whose Activity start is dropped.
